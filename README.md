======================================

_ecoCode_ is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level. The goal of
the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative
ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware", shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

_ecoCode_ is based on evolving catalogs of [good practices](docs/rules), for various technologies. A SonarQube plugin
then implements these catalogs as rules for scanning your projects.

**Warning**: this is still a very early stage project. Any feedback or contribution will be highly appreciated. Please
refer to the contribution section.

### eco-design SonarQube plugin

![Ekko logo](docs/resources/5ekko.png)

There are two kinds of plugins :

- One for web / backoffice (PHP, Python, Java, JavaScript), using smells described in the 2nd edition of the repository
  published in september 2015.
  You can find all the
  rules [here (in french)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nujR4EnajnR0NSXjvBW3GytOopDyTfvl3eTk2XGLh5Y/edit#gid=1386834576).
  The current repository is for web / backOffice
- One for mobile (Android), using [a set of smells](https://olegoaer.perso.univ-pau.fr/android-energy-smells/) theorised
  by Olivier Le Goa√´r for Android.
  You can find this plugin in the repository [here](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecocode-mobile)

### How a SonarQube plugin works

Code is parsed to be transformed as AST. AST will allow you to access one or more nodes of your code.
For example, you‚Äôll be able to access of all your `for` loop, to explore content etc.

To better understand AST structure, you can use the [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/).

üöÄ Getting Started
------------------

You can quickly have a look of ecoCode plugins with docker. Plase have a look at "Getting started" section of each plugin :

- [Java plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-java?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started)
- [PHP plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-php?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started)
- [Python plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-python?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started)
- [C# plugin](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-csharp?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started)

üõí Distribution
------------------

The main way to get ecoCode plugins is to download them from your SonarQube Marketplace (available in Administration section).
But if you want, you can also download them from GitHub releases.

We had split our plugins repository `ecocode` to one repository for each plugin on december 2023.
Thus, plugin versions are available on 2 repositories depending on version you want :
